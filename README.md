# Proof-of-Concept

A brief explanation of proof of concepts

Project 1). Deployment of a sample web application on EKS

* We have deployed a sample web application consisting of two services. One is a Web app, which will be our UI, and the second one is a database service. 
* The database service is connected to a web service for data communication purposes.
* We have set up a public-facing load balancer to serve external requests.

Project 2). My learning path for Jenkins

* In this project, I have elaborated my learning of Jenkins from the scratch. I am still in process of learning it in depth.
